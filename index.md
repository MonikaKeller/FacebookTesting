## Welcome to Monika Keller's page

This web site organizes my reference work.

You can get a feeling of my present professional skills. 

## The Facebook Testing project

I created this project because I am a facebook user and so many faults during operation.

I selected two parts of the application where these were most embarassing.

### Test Plan

This gives an overview of the testing activities and methods.

### Test Cases

The detailed instructions on what to test and how.

### Test Cycles

The cycles are sets of test cases selected for execution.

### Reports

Among these reports you can find both bug reports and reports for the management.
